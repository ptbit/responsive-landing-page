              Separate structure from presentation from behavior. Strictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting) apart, and try to keep the interaction between the three to an absolute minimum. That is, make sure documents and templates contain only HTML and HTML that is solely serving structural purposes. Move everything presentational into style sheets, and everything behavioral into scripts. In addition, keep the contact area as small as possible by linking as few style sheets and scripts as possible from documents and templates. Separating structure from presentation from behavior is important for maintenance reasons.
